## Prerequisite:

Must download [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/), a desktop customization tool.

##

## Features:

- Starting at 45 seconds, red gradient leads up until 00. Resets, becomes green from 01 to 15. From 15 to 44, it remains white. From 45 to 59, it will become more and more red.

- From minute spectrum, from 6:25 AM to 6:30 AM, it remains green representing the market is about to open. From 6:31 to 6:45, it becomes more and more green from white to green. At around 7:00, it becomes red. It stops at 7:15 I believe and remains white. Upon 15 minutes to the hour being up, it remains more and more red. Past 9 AM, it should stay white.

- Key momentum times in the market: 6:30 AM to 7:15 AM PST. Second key momentum time is from 10:15 AM to 11:45 AM. You may add power hour, but I don't find much luck then.

Hey all, I made this specifically to with my own style of trading...

Notes:

First and foremost, this application is written in Rainmeter's own programming language. You must download Rainmeter and place it on your screen in order for it to work. This is a skin, so please install rainmeter.exe FIRST from rainmeter.net, and THEN download the .rmskin and run it.

.rmskin file is located in the *build* folder. If you prefer doing it manually, download the source code and load the Stocks folder inside Rainmeter.

Beware, this will use 5% - 10% (max) CPU due to Rainmeter's API.

- I trade the ORB at 6:30 AM PST. You will need to modify the time in each .ini file under seconds, minutes, and hours if you want this to work to your strategy. If you trade at 9:30 AM EST every day for example, you would adjust each ini file accordingly.

- You can change the RGBA and the time frame for when the RGBA changes. You;d ahve to do so accordingly in the .ini file

- If you need a tutorial on how to download Rainmeter skins, check that out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgLnayDD_qY) via YouTube.

Will be updating this readme later on...
