# Rainmeter

Hey all, I made this specifically to with my own style of trading...

Notes:

First and foremost, this application is written in Rainmeter's own programming language. You msut download Rainmeter and place it on your screen in order for it to work. This is a skin, so please install rainmeter.exe FIRST from rainmeter.net, and THEN download the .rskin and run it. Thanks!

- I trade the ORB at 6:30 AM PST. You will need to modify the time in each .ini file under seconds, minutes, and hours if you want this to work to your strategy. If you trade at 9:30 AM EST every day for example, you would adjust each ini file accordingly.

- You can change the RGBA and the time frame for when the RGBA changes. You;d ahve to do so accordingly in the .ini file



Will be updating this readme later on...
